# SpriteKitWatchFace - "Original Apple Watch" Watch Face
Simple project to create a 'fake' Apple Watch watch face using Sprite Kit.

This repo is based on @steventroughtonsmith 's great work (https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/SpriteKitWatchFace)

For code simplicity, I've removed other watch faces, they are still available in original repo
